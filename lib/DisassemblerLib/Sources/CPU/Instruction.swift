 A concrete representation of a single instruction in a CPU's instruction set.

 A instruction provides a complete representation of a specific operation that the CPU is able to perform.

 Each Instruction has an associated specification (spec). The spec defines the shape and size of the Instruction, but
 not the conrete values contained within; the Instruction is expected to store the concrete information such as an
 immediate (imm) value or a memory address.

 A representation of theÂ shape of instructions found in a CPU's instruction set.

 Implementing this protocol makes it possible to calculate the size of a given instruction.

 This protocol is typically implemented as an enum type in which each case defines the shape of a single instruction.
 If the instruction set has prefix instructions (e.g. two-byte instructions in an otherwise single-byte instruction set)
 then the enum can be declared `indirect` in order to support recursion.
