 A instruction provides a complete representation of a specific operation that the CPU is able to perform.

 not the conrete values contained within; the Instruction is expected to store the concrete information such as an

 A representation of theÂ shape of instructions found in a CPU's instruction set.

 Implementing this protocol makes it possible to calculate the size of a given instruction.

 This protocol is typically implemented as an enum type in which each case defines the shape of a single instruction.
 If the instruction set has prefix instructions (e.g. two-byte instructions in an otherwise single-byte instruction set)
 then the enum can be declared `indirect` in order to support recursion.

 This type conforms to Hashable because instruction specifications are often used as keys in lookup tables.
